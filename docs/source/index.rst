Privtext's documentation!
====================================

Privtext is a command line utility for creating private text messages on privtext.com. It is a must have utility for system administrators.

Data (encrypted by privtext client) is sent to our server for storage, and the encryption key is attached to part of url that our server does not have access to. The secure url is returned by the script for you to share in instant messengers and emails.
